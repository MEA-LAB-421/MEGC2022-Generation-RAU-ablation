## Ablation Studies.

In this part, we perform an relative AU~(RAU) ablation experiment to verify the effectiveness of the introduced relative AU constraint. The comparison results are shown below.

### 
*From the **generated results of SAMM_Negative_018_3_1-Template_Female_Asian**, we can see that after incorporating relative AUs, the unnatural contraction around the left corner of mouth as well as the left ring of nose are suppressed to a considerable extent. We believe that this is because by adding AU constraint, the model learns to focus on the facial regions most related to the expression and brings about desirable changes.
	This validates the effectiveness of our proposed method, since TPS-only implementation fails to capture the subtleness of micro-expressions, but our method in contrast uses relative AUs as guidance to generate samples in a fine-grained way.
  
*From the **generated results of SAMM_Positive_022_3_3-Template_Male_Asian**, we can find out that typical characteristics of a positive expression, i.e., rise of both sides of corner of the mouth are clearly manifested in samples generated by our method. However, without AU constraint, only the left side of the corner rises, which resembles more to a contempt(negative) expression.
This indicates that AU constraint to some extent helps our model understand more about semantics of the expression and helps to generate more expressive samples.
